                        I have been a Health Science teacher since 2012 after a twenty year career in nursing. I have taught a plethora of courses including Pharmacology, Clinical Rotation, Medical Terminology, Principles of Health Science, Counseling and Mental Health, Medical Microbiology, Certified Nurse Aide, Introduction to Nursing and more. All these classes required me to create my own curriculum that kept my students interested and engaged in the learning process. The products you will find in my TPT store reflect a finely tuned and student-tested amalgamation of that work.

                        Students applying for Health Science courses usually have a genuine desire to pursue a healthcare career so it’s not difficult to get them interested during first semester… keeping them interested all year long is the trick! I found that they enjoy a strong routine and being afforded the opportunity to excel. So, they always know the expectations of each new chapter and what to expect from a grading standpoint. Every chapter has a set of hands-on activities related to the field of healthcare whether it be auscultating the sound of their heart with a stethoscope, demonstrating CPR, taking vital signs, or transporting a patient in a wheelchair. Every exam is preceded by a fun and engaging review game to help prepare them for success in the classroom.

                        After twenty years in the military, I retired from Air Force nursing in 2008. I had always wanted to become a teacher and I found out about the Troops to Teachers program that helps veterans become certified and employed K-12 teachers. With their help, I became a certified Health Science educator in the Career and Technology Education program. I taught high school for eight years and I am now a nursing instructor at a local university.
